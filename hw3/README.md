# Homework 3: Gradient Operators, LoG, Edge Keypoints & Corner Keypoints
This assignment contains two main components:
  1. Image Derivative Computation
  2. Keypoint Detection (Edge-based + Corner-based)
All outputs are automatically generated and saved for visualization.


# Part 1 — Gradient Magnitude, Gradient Angle & Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
This section computes three different derivative-based representations for every input image:
  * Gradient Magnitude (Sobel)
  * Gradient Orientation (Sobel angle, visualized in degrees)
  * Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) for second-derivative edge detection
These operations highlight edge strength, edge direction, and intensity curvature.

# Input Example
